      Cookies are text files containing small amounts of data that are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. There are several types of cookies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Temporarily stored in your browser’s memory and deleted when you close your browser. These cookies help the website recognize you during your single visit and allow essential functionality (e.g., keeping you logged in while navigating pages).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Remain on your device for a predetermined period even after you close your browser. They remember your preferences and website interactions over multiple visits (e.g., language selection, saved login credentials).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First-Party Cookies:</strong> Set and managed by our website domain (overeye.net). We use them for core functionality and to remember user settings.
      </li>
      <li>

    </p>

  <!-- Data Retention and Storage -->
  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      We retain cookie-related data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the cookie was set. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Deleted when you close your browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Retained for a maximum of two years or until you delete them via your browser settings, whichever comes first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Data is stored for 14 months on third-party servers (e.g., Google Analytics) before being automatically deleted or aggregated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marketing Cookies:</strong> Retained for up to 12 months on third-party servers (e.g., Facebook Pixel, DoubleClick).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any data derived from cookies that is no longer necessary or that you have withdrawn consent for will be deleted or anonymized. We do not combine cookie data with any personally identifiable information unless you have explicitly provided it (e.g., by submitting a form).
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Non-Cookie Tracking Technologies -->
  <section>
    <h2>Non-Cookie Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to cookies, we may use other tracking technologies such as local storage, session storage, web beacons, and pixel tags. These technologies serve similar purposes as cookies—storing preferences, tracking usage, and measuring performance—but function differently at the technical level. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Storage / Session Storage:</strong> Data stored locally in your browser that persists beyond a single session (local storage) or only for the duration of your browsing session (session storage). Used for storing user preferences without sending data back to the server on every request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Web Beacons / Pixel Tags:</strong> Small, transparent images embedded in web pages or emails that allow us to track visits, page views, and email opens. These are often used by analytics and marketing partners.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can control or delete web beacons and local storage items via your browser settings. To learn more, refer to the documentation of your specific browser.
